# Position Media Scouts (front-end)

A simple UI for an AI-driven tool called Position Media Scouts (PMS). This tool is a group of agents that help you find articles and YouTube interview videos of a person who is in a position at a company.

## How it works:

Let's say you want to catch up on the latest about Apple's CEO. Reading their recent articles or watching interview videos can be a great way to do that. All you need to do is type "Apple, CEO" into the UI, PMS will then get to work, searching the internet for recent articles they've published and videos of their interviews on YouTube. The tool will neatly organize the links to these articles and videos and present them to you in the UI.

## Get started:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

_Important: Before you start working on the front-end, make sure to clone the back-end and get it running first._
